# LSTH-Tut-1

# Wired Calculator Simulation
This electronic Calculator is a Python application built using the Tkinter GUI library. It simulates a basic calculator with operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a user-friendly interface with clickable numeric and operation buttons, making it easy for users to perform calculations just like they would on a physical calculator.

# Features

Numeric Buttons (0-9): Allows users to input numbers by clicking.
Operation Buttons: Includes addition (ADD), subtraction (SUBS), multiplication (MULT), and division (DIV).
Load and Calculate: Users can load numbers and then perform an operation. The result can be displayed by clicking the OUT button.
Clear Input: The calculator clears the input after each operation or when the LOAD button is pressed, ready for a new calculation.
Pretty GUI: A visually appealing interface with color-coded buttons and a responsive layout.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter library (usually comes with Python)

# Setup and Running the Application
Ensure Python 3.x is Installed:

You can download Python from the official website.
During installation, ensure you select the option to add Python to your PATH.
Verify Tkinter Installation:

Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python. You can verify its installation by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

python -m tkinter

A small window should appear if Tkinter is correctly installed. If not, you might need to install it following specific instructions for your operating system.
Download the Calculator Code:
Save the provided Python code into a file named LSTH.py.

# Run the Application:

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved LSTH.py, and run the following command:

python LSTH.py

The calculator interface should now open, and you can start using it immediately.

# Instruction Set
Enter the first number, press Load.

Enter the second number, press load.

Enter the operation you want to perform(add, sub, mul, div).

Enter the out button.

Result will be displayed on the screen.

# Customization
Feel free to modify the code to add more operations or change the GUI according to your preferences. The operation functions (add, subs, mult, div) are defined in the Calculator class and can be easily updated or extended.
